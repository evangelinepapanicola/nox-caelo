=== welcome_to_luna ===

You're falling for what feels like ages, almost like you're skydiving at midnight, in space, with the stars falling all around you. You can hear Cerberus howling above you, until you eventually catch him and hold him in your arms tightly.

CRASH!

The three of you land in a heap on a pavement, Parvus breaking your fall and Cerberus on top of you still in your arms. It's daylight. You look around and you're in a place you don't recognise... a city that looks almost like it's from medieval times. People are walking the streets, seemingly going about their daily lives just fine.

    "That, my friend, is a story for another time... and by that, I mean I am bound by an oath that means I cannot tell you." -> explore_luna
    
* [What now?]
    "We begin 'Parvus' master plan to save the people of Luna', which begins with you getting ready to go dungeoneering. I'll explain more later. For now, I suggest you go explore the town, get yourself a weapon and some... suitable armour..." he says, looking at your dog walking clothes with a face that says "trying not too look disgusted".
    "Meet me back here by the town gates when you're ready to go!"
    
    You stand there, still gobsmacked and coming to terms with what on earth just happened. You're not entirely sure what the right thing is to do in this situation, but your phone has no signal or battery, and you have no idea how you'd even attempt to get back home. You aren't sure what this Parvus guy's intentions are, but perhaps It's worth hearing him out.
    
    You go for a walk to clear your head.

    * * [Change clothes]
        You go and find the stalls Parvus was talking about and change into the "armour" he gave you. Weirdly, it's a perfect fit. You look like a brave warrior, a knight, or perhaps like you got lost on the way to Comic-Con.

=== ignis_arena ===
"Alright, let's get going!"
And with that, you and Parvus begin your 3 days of travelling to Ignis Arena. You travel there on horseback, stopping to rest and camp every now and then.

On day 2, you're settled down by an open fire, with Cerberus snoozing in your lap. You wonder if you'll ever get to go home again.
Parvus notices you deep in thought.
"Thank you."
* [For what?]
"For helping me with all of this.
* [Wow, about time!]
"Yeah I know, I know, It's really overdue.
* [Don't worry about it.]
- <> It really means a lot to me. I was born and raised in Luna, the people are my family. I can't bear to watch any more die. But I know how big this task I ask of you is. You must be missing so much from your realm."

You and Parvus chat for a while, and then rest before continuing on your journey.
Eventually, you arrive at the huge stone walls around the entrance to Ignis Arena.

"Alright, good luck!" Parvus exclaims. "I'll be waiting out here for you."

You swallow every ounce of fear inside of you, and make your way into the arena entrance.

The entrance is packed with loud people, swigging beer and chanting. You see a desk in the back titled "SIGN UPS" where a receptionist is sat, looking bored and picking at her nails.
A large, athletic looking man in armour stumbles into the entrance from the arena, his face covered in bruises, a gash on his cheek and blood stains scattered over him. The people give him a small cheer as he enters, and an even taller man gives him a hard pat on the back, saying with a deep voice, "Better luck next time, lad." The bloodied man wheezes at the pat on the back.

You approach the desk. The receptionist doesn't seem to notice your presence.

* [Hello?]
* [Excuse me!]

- (receptionist) {!The lady looks up at you, slightly confused.}
{!"Can I help you?"}

* [Do you know where I can find the Tome of Warfare?]
    You hear someone behind you spit-take, another person chuckles.
    The lady looks at you, eyes wide, "Uh, excuse me? You want the Tome of Warfare? Oh little one... the only way you'll get your hands on that is by defeating the reigning arena champion. He hasn't been defeated in 50 years."
    * * [I'll fight him.]
        "Are you sure? You'll need a sponsor to fight."
        * * * [I'm sure, but-]
            You tell the lady you're sure you'll fight. Just as you start to tell her you don't have a sponsor yet, you feel a hand on your shoulder. 
            "I'll sponsor." You look up, and a tall, muscular lady covered in scars, with a buzzcut, silver hair and dark, smudged makeup is standing by you. She gives you a mischievous grin. 
            The receptionist sighs. "Alrighty then, your spot's at 5pm. Don't be late."
            ->talk_with_cereza
        
* [I want to fight.]
The receptionist looks you up and down. "Uh, okay, well here's the list of challengers and rewards." She hands you a crumpled up piece of paper.

You spend time going through the whole list, looking for a fight with the reward being the Tome of Warfare. At the very bottom, you find "Fighter: Marg the Destroyer, Reward: The Tome of Warfare."

You tell the receptionist you want to fight Marg the Destroyer.

The lady looks at you, eyes wide, "Uh, excuse me? Oh little one... that's the reigning arena champion. He hasn't been defeated in 50 years."

{!You introduce yourself. "I can tell you're a newbie, {players_name}. It's very rare that anyone would come in here to challenge Marg the Destroyer. It's suicide.}
* [Why did you sponsor me?]
I'm curious to see what tricks you have up your sleeve. I'm a regular in this arena. I've seen the typical type of people come and go. Bounty hunters, mercenaries, people who are simply looking for thrills. But if I'm honest, you don't seem like much of a fighter. Which means you're probably after the Tome of Warfare. Why do you need such a powerful artefact?"

        ->talk_with_cereza
* [How do I beat this guy?]
"Honestly, little one." She sighs. "If I knew, I'd tell you. Trust me. Not even I have defeated Marg the Destroyer. He's ruled this arena for 50 years. But honestly, the best advice I have for you, based on your uh, weapon of choice... 
{weaponEquipped =="bow": <> try and use high ground to your advantage, and try and stay far back from him so he can't hit you."}

"{players_name}! You're up!" You hear the announcer call your name.
"Looks like it's your time to shine, little one." Cereza pats you hard on the back, and the two of you head into the Arena. "GOOD LUCK!" Cereza yells as she goes to take her seat, while you nervously head into the center ring.
You hear the crowd roaring and chanting as you enter, it's almost deafening.
"EVERYBODY PLEASE WELCOME YOUR NEW CHALLENGER! {players_name}! FROM! LUNAAAA!" The announcer yells, and the crowd roars even louder.

You take some time to look around the huge arena. There are two gates, the one you came from and the one on the opposite side. On the west and east sides of the ring are high platforms. There is also a mud pit in the centre. You decide you should find a good position, before Marg appears.

You decide to it would be advantageous to use the high ground, so you climb the west platform.

You decide to stand by the mud pit.

* (hide)[Hide by Marg's door]
You hide by Marg's door, hoping to catch him by surprise.

- "FIGHTING {players_name} TODAY, WE HAVE MARG THE DESTROYERRRR!" The announcer calls out, and everyone gasps. You start to hear people muttering and whispering to eachother.
The opposite gate clunks open, and from the shadows you see a huge, monsterous troll appear, his stomping footsteps shaking the arena slightly. He roars, and the crowd starts to chant his name.

{mud_pit: You watch as Marg trudges through the mud pit towards you until you are face to face.}

+ {hide} [Attempt to grapple him]
You try to grapple him, but it's harder than you thought with a bow in hand. Irritated, Marg grabs your arms and throws you overhead on to the ground. You feel the pain spread through your whole body as you lie on the ground. You get up as quickly as you can.

+ {west_platform || east_platform} [Shoot an arrow at one of his hands]
As he starts to climb the ladder up, you try to aim an arrow at his right hand. It hits, and he wails in pain, removing his hand from the ladder and is forced to jump down.

As soon as Marg stands up on to the platform, you shoot an arrow at him- but he catches the arrow perfectly, throwing it onto the ground beneath you. You feel frozen with fear, and before you can process what is happening, Marg slams his fist into your face, sending you flying off the platform and crashing into the ground. You feel the pain spread through your whole body as you lie there, and get up as quickly as you can.
Marg jumps back down from the ladder and looms over you.

+ {mud_pit} [Shoot an arrow at his foot]
You shoot an arrow at his foot and he starts hopping on the other foot, clutching his now wounded foot in pain. He staggers backwards before losing his balance and falling back into the mud pit.

Out of breath, you look around at the crowd as they cheer, chanting your name.
"{players_name}! {players_name}! {players_name}! {players_name}!"
You have won the fight.

Leaning on Cereza for support, you limp back into the arena entrance. As you enter, the people raise their drinks and cheer once again. 

"That was incredible, {players_name}." Cereza looks at you, excitedly. "I've never seen anything quite like it. You have to stay, continue fighting here at the arena. I'll be your coach!"

* [I'm sorry, I have a mission to complete...]
    Cereza sighs, but gives you a look of understanding. "I had a feeling you'd say that. I understand. I'm proud of you, little one. Keep in touch, yeah?"
* [You're kidding, right? That was too easy.]
Cereza chuckes. "Hah, the confidence of a champion. I understand you have things to do. Good luck out there little one. Don't be a stranger, okay?"

- "Impressive display." You hear a deep voice interrupt. You realise you're suddenly stood in a large shadow, and you turn around to see Marg, holding some ice to his chin. You gulp.
Marg chuckles. "Don't worry, the fight is over. Congratulations, nobody has beaten me in a long, long time. Here - I believe this is yours." He hands you a large book with a red velvet hardback cover. You look at the title etched on to it: "The Tome of Warfare."

You say your goodbyes to Cereza and the rest of the arena folk, and make your way out to find Parvus again.

Tome in hand, you journey back to Luna.
